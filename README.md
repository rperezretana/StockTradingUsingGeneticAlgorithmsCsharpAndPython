# StockTradingUsingGeneticAlgorithmsCsharpAndPython

This bot was generated by a genetic algorithm that runs trading simulation 24/7 in a couple of private servers.
The bot was selected as the best on its trading style by the algorithm and then placed here.
The genetic algorithm was written in C# but the code to be run is in Python.
I will not share the ToroBot Agent trainer for now, but I will share the algorithm thatI wrote and the generated Agent.

The autogenerated code is only the class class TraderAgent_RSIBASED_RGQF the rest was the algorithm used as a base to be used during generation and trading and it was manually writen.

To run it you will have to create a Quantopian account, and run it in there since their libraries are not available for external use ( it is free to use tho).
The algorithm is no longer usefull since XIV stopped trading in 2018-02-12 but by then the algorithm got a profit of 353.24% for the current portfolio real money trading ( my personal portfolio).
If the algorithm was run from 12-10-2010 to 2018-02-12 it would have made 24719% in profits.

To run:
- Create quantopian account.
- Create new Algorithm.
- Copy and paste the code.
- Run backtest.


Note: This algorithm is no longer useful since XIV stopped trading in 2018-02-13
